Machine Learning California Housing Prices Prediction using Scikit-Learn

üè° **California Housing Prices Prediction**

Welcome to the California Housing Prices Prediction project repository! This project focuses on predicting housing prices in California using machine learning techniques.

üìö **Overview**

The California housing market is renowned for its dynamic and diverse pricing trends. In this project, we dive into historical housing data to build a robust model capable of estimating accurate property prices across different locations.

üìä **Dataset**

This analysis is based on the [California Housing Prices Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices). This dataset comprises a rich set of features, including median income, housing median age, average rooms, and more. Each entry represents a block group in California, with the median house value serving as the target variable.

üî¨ **Methodology**

1. **Data Preprocessing**: We start by cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and performing feature engineering to ensure the data is ready for modeling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical analyses provide insights into the data, helping us understand the intricate relationships between variables.

3. **Model Selection**: We experiment with a variety of regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Our model selection is based on careful consideration of performance metrics.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets, enabling us to train our chosen model and rigorously evaluate its performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

5. **Deployment (Optional)**: Depending on your needs, we explore the possibility of deploying the trained model to an API endpoint or a web application, facilitating real-time price predictions.

üöÄ **Usage**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kekele-star/california-housing-prices-prediction.git
   cd california-housing-prices-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Delve into the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to grasp the data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation processes.

4. Unleash your creativity by training your own models using the code provided in the `src/` directory.
